# ImpliedMarkets
ImpliedMarkets provides data and analysis to understand if now is the right time to buy or sell a stock by calculating four measures:
1. The risk-neutral probability density function of the stock price, implied by option markets using the Breeden-Litzenberger function
2. Comparing the risk-neutral pdf to other stocks and finding the most similar ones by Wasserstein-distance
3. Determining the most influential macroeconomic variables for the stock price using linear regression
4. Predicting if volatility of a stock will rise, fall, or stay the same using machine learning
